# Module 2 Homework (Automate Your Day Job with Python)
## _Attempting only [PyBank]; skipping the optional [PyRamen] challenge_

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records (from the provided 'budget_data.csv' file to calculate each of the following:

   _1. The total number of months included in the dataset_
 
   _2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period_
 
   _3. Average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period_
 
   _4. Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period_
 
   _5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period._


Finally, the PyBank script should print the final analysis to the terminal **and** export a text file with the results. The output result expected for the provided data sample is:

 ```text
 **Financial Analysis*
 ---------------------
 Total Months: 86
 Total: $38382578
 Average  Change: $-2315.12
 Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
 Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
 ```
